# postgresql_curl
Bash scrip that reads data from PostgreSQL and POST it with curl to Intercom

To execute this script you need:
1. [Interactive terminal for working with Postgres (psql)](http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html).
2. AuthToken for the [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com) account

You likely already have psql installed if youâ€™ve ever installed Postgres or TimescaleDB before.
If not - use this [installation guide](https://blog.timescale.com/tutorials/how-to-install-psql-on-mac-ubuntu-debian-windows/).
